<h1 align="center">Nodewire</h1>

<p align="center">
  A Minecraft Forge 1.20.1 mod that replaces redstone with a node-based logic system. Build logic visually in an in-world editor, then export it as a reusable graph — across ship boundaries (Valkyrien Skies) and alongside Create.
</p>

> **Status:** early in development. Core editor, save/load, groups, comments, and wire labels are working. APIs and save formats are not yet stable.

## Features

- **Visual node editor** opened on a placed Nodewire block. Pan, zoom, drag nodes, draw wires.
- **Save & load graphs** to client-side files (`<gamedir>/nodewire-graphs/<name>.snbt`) and reuse them between worlds.
- **Node groups** — collapse parts of a graph into a reusable subgraph. Groups can be nested, saved as standalone templates, and live-synced when you edit the master.
- **Comments + wire labels** — annotate the editor with floating text boxes and label individual wires for legibility.
- **Cross-ship logic** — designed to function across Valkyrien Skies ship boundaries.
- **Create-friendly** — works alongside Create 6.0.8 + Ponder + Flywheel.

## Stack

- Minecraft **1.20.1** + Forge **47.4.10**
- Kotlin **2.0.20** + Kotlin for Forge **4.11.0**
- Build plugin: **`net.neoforged.moddev.legacyforge` 2.0.141** (ModDevGradle, not ForgeGradle 6)
- Java toolchain: **17**
- Custom UI framework on top of **Compose runtime 1.7.0** (no Skiko, no AWT) + **Yoga** (AppliedEnergistics fork, rebuilt for Java 17)
- Integrations: Valkyrien Skies 2, Create 6.0.8, JEI, EMI

## Build

```bash
./gradlew build      # compile + reobf, ~30s incremental
./gradlew test       # unit tests
```

ModDevGradle generates IDE run configurations automatically on Gradle sync — re-import the project in IntelliJ after editing `build.gradle.kts`. No manual `genIntellijRuns`.

The bundled `libs/yoga-1.0.0-j17.jar` is included so the project builds out of the box. To rebuild it yourself (e.g., when bumping the Yoga version) see [`docs/yoga-rebuild.md`](docs/yoga-rebuild.md).

## In-game

1. Launch the client (`./gradlew runClient` or via IntelliJ).
2. Enter a world.
3. Press **N** to open the dev demo screen, or place the Nodewire block and right-click it to open the editor.

See [`docs/usage.md`](docs/usage.md) for the editing workflow, keybinds, node categories, and mod-integration details.

## Contributing

This project is in early development. If you'd like to contribute:

1. Open an issue first to discuss the change.
2. Match existing patterns — look at neighbouring files before introducing new abstractions.
3. Add unit tests where reasonable; the existing test suite (under `src/test/kotlin`) covers graph codecs, group operations, and the proxy-pin labeling rules.
