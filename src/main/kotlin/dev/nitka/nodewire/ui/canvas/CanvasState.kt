/**
 * Pan + zoom state for a [NodeCanvas]. Mirrors [ScrollState]'s easing
 * pattern: each axis has a `target` written by input handlers and a
 * `current` value eased toward it one frame at a time by [advance], which
 * NwUiOwner runs from the post-layout walk.
 *
 *   * `panX` / `panY` — translation in world units. Multiplied by [zoom]
 *     during paint. Positive pan moves the world right/down (content
 *     follows the cursor when dragging).
 *   * `zoom` — uniform scale factor. Clamped to [[MIN_ZOOM], [MAX_ZOOM]].
 *     1.0 = native pixels.
