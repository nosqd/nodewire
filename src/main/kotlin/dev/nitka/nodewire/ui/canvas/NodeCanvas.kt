/**
 * Infinite pannable / zoomable surface for node-graph cards. Children
 * positioned with `.absolutePosition(worldX, worldY)` are laid out in world
 * space; PaintWalk + HitTester apply [state]'s pan and zoom uniformly.
 *
 * Drag with the middle mouse button to pan, Ctrl + wheel to zoom around
 * the cursor. Left/right clicks pass through to children — so node cards
 * keep their normal click semantics.
 *
 * Sizing: the canvas itself takes whatever Yoga gives it (typically
 * fillMaxSize). The transform happens inside its bounds; content outside is
 * scissor-clipped by [PaintWalk].
 *
 * Provides [LocalCanvasState] so children (e.g. node cards) can scale
 * their own drag handling by the current zoom.
